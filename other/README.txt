ABOUT THE WEBSITE

All of the HTML files are in the main folder.

All of the CSS files are in the styles folder.
 - the file sitewide_styles.css is for the top banner + logo, body background, to top button, and the footer.
 - the file container_styles.css is for styling the h2, h4, and p paragraphs for every container.
 
There is unutilized code in the other folder.
 - the file type is all because the documents contain HTML, CSS, and JS.
 - the calendar code is for a static calendar; the calendar needs to accept events added to it.
 - the slide show code will be put in when there's more pictures.
